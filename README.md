# Personality Quiz Starter Code

This is a place for you to start building your personality quiz!

### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Have at least three questions.
- Have at least two answers to each question that correspond to the quiz outcomes.
- Allow a person to select an answer by clicking a button.
- Display different outcomes for different combinations of answer selections.


### Extensions
You can extend your project further by:
- Adding more questions to your quiz.
- Customizing the look and feel with CSS.
- Allow a person to restart the quiz by clicking a button.
- Creating a button to update result instead of having it display unprompted.
- Disabling buttons after a person selects an answer.

This personality quiz is just a fun little quiz that will try to determine whether you are a movie or book lover based on the attributes of your dream pet! I made it as part of GWC's SPP, and I really enjoyed making it. I hope you enjoy it and find it fun!
